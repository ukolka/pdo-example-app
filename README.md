Quoting the person I've made it for:

I would like a couple of working example PHP files that do the following database tasks using PDO. 

1. add new form data from page to database, with and with out check if already exists or not. 

2. page from database X number of results (changeable exp: 10, 20, 50, All) with page links(First Prev 1 2 3 Next Last), with edit / delete option. live searching. ability to sort by column.
